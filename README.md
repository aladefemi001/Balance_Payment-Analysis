## 📘 Project Overview

The **Balance of Payments (BoP)** is a critical financial statement that reflects a country's economic transactions with the world. It comprises three main components:
- **Current Account**: Trade in goods and services, income, and remittances.
- **Capital Account**: Transfers of financial assets (e.g., grants, investments).
- **Financial Account**: Changes in international asset ownership, including foreign investments.

This project presents a comprehensive economic analysis of five European countries: **Albania, Austria, Belgium, France, and Germany**. It reveals trade balances, investment trends, and international financial activities using key indicators from BoP data.
